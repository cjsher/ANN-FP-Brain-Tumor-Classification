Class Distribution in Training and Validation Sets
  [insert link to that block of code]
  Using our set of warbler species, 'class_names' , and counts of each class' occurences in our spectrograms, we made a two-group bar chart. (X: warbler species, Y: species instances per set)

Training and Validation Accuracy
  [insert link to that block of code}
  Using the history of our model's training process (training accuracy and validation accuracy), we made a two-group line chart. (X: epochs, Y: accuracy metric)
  
Training and Validation Loss

  Using the history of our model's training process (training loss and validation loss), we made a two-group line chart. (X: epochs, Y: loss metric)
Confusion Matrix
  [insert link to that block of codel
  Using the class names of 'Y_true' and 'Y_pred', we made a typical confusion matrix.
  To plot it properly, we added a colormap, colorbar, axis ticks, colormap-dependent text, and normalized decimal values.
